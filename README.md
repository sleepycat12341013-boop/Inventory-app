## Inventory App — simple and mobile friendly

I made this for small businesses that still use paper or Excel.

### ✨ Features (Planned)

- Archive System
- Mobile Access
- Role-Based Permissions
- Firebase Integration
- Add Confirmation Screen

### ✨ Features (Done)

- Search Function
- Item List View
- Add / Delete Items
- Duplicate Prevention

My goal is to let teams access inventory from anywhere, even on their phones.
Next, I want to add Firebase sync and role permissions.
